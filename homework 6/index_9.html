<h1 align="center">Overview of Kyiv,Ukraine</h1>
<p align="justify">Kyiv is the capital of Ukraine with more than 1500 years of history. Being a charming city with splendid architecture, ancient golden-domed cathedrals and 
numerous parks on both sides of the mighty Dnipro River, Kyiv is a tourist’s delight. During a city tour you will have the possibility to visit the 
famous Andriyivsky Uzviz Descent where numerous artists and craftsmen present their works both for observation and for sale; the Golden Gate – the 
remains of a huge wall that was erected in the 10th century to protect the city, and the Parliament building situated in a beautiful park. The 
enormous territory of the city makes it hard at first to find one’s way but luckily, there are two helpful guide points – the Dnipro and the Metro. 
The river crosses the city in a north-south direction; the old town is situated on the high and steep right bank, while the left bank is low and flat 
having 80% of all residential houses located there. Old Kyiv (the Upper Town), known as the “Mother of Rus cities”, has ancient monuments that show the 
art of the old builders and culture of the Ukrainian nation. Although the city has changed its visage to a modern face, nothing can change the 
greatness of the ancient monuments and the mighty Dnipro . Near the Upper Town and Podil (where ships are docked) is Pechersk, one of the oldest 
districts of the city. Its name is closely connected to the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra Monastery (“pechery” means caves), the most significant Monastery 
of ancient old Kyiv Rus state and still one of 6 shrines (6 Lavra monasteries , spread out throughout the world) and places of worship of Orthodox 
Christianity.

<h2 align="center">Description of Kyiv sights</h2>
<h3 align="center">Khreschatyk street and Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence) Square</h3>
<p>The main and most popular street in the city, Khreschatyk , was reconstructed several times and is now one of the most beautiful places in the 
capital. Khreschatyk combines the features of a vital business center with the charming historic and architectural feel of the 19th century. The 
street leads to the main square of the city, Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), that, since 2004 became the center of all breakpoint 
milestone events in the history of modern Ukraine, including Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Revolution of Honor in 2014, and , thus, a symbol 
of Ukrainian Independence. After tragic events of the 20th of January 2014 when over 100 civilians were killed during the Revolution of Honor, 
widely known as EuroMaidan, Maidan Nezalezhnosti hosts a huge memorial with photos of those who perished, placed all along “Geroyev Nebesnoy Sotni” 
street (street of Heavenly Hundred). For Kievites, Maidan Nezalezhnosti, that before 2014 was widely treated as a place of light joy and entertainment
, house of street music in the underground passageway, known as “Truba”, meeting point with friends, source of new positive emotions, changed forever 
with its new sense of sadness brought by all the grave events that happened. 
Maidan Nezalezhnosti is definitely one of main Kyiv must sees. 
On weekends Khreschatyk turns into a pedestrian zone and people can stroll right down the middle of the street. Nightlife on Khreschatyk, with its 
wide range of emotions, will only complement your daily impressions of the city.

<h3 align="center">Andriyivsky Uzviz in Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>
<p>Andriyivvsky Uzviz (St. Andrew’s Decsent) is known for its bohemian atmosphere. Whatever the weather is like , you can always see artists 
displaying their works there. It is the best place to buy souvenirs made by Ukrainian craftsmen. Andriyivskiy Uzviz has become a traditional place 
for fairs, festivals, concerts and Days of Kyiv. Many museums and art galleries tell the history of this legendary street, as well as that of  Kyiv 
in general. Numerous shops, studios and cafes – everything you find here is absolutely perfect for a good rest. 
The main adornment of the street is St. Andrew’s Church. It was designed by the famous Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli and is a wonderful 
example of the 17th century Baroque architecture. Especially valuable is the interior, boasting numerous carvings and iconostasis painting.
</p>
<h3 align="center">Volodymy the Baptist</h3>
<p>One the slope of Volodymyrska Hirka (Hill) overlooking the Dnipro River is a monument to Grand Prince Volodymyr, who is also called the Baptizer 
of Rus. It was he who introduced Christianity to Kyiv Rus in 988 a.d. The bronze statue of Grand Prince Volodymyr was erected in 1853.
Golden Gate
The Gate was the main part of the city’s fortification complex built in 1037. The complex marked the borders of old Kyiv during the time of Grand 
Prince Yaroslav. For centuries it served as a line of defense against many enemies. This important historical landmark was rebuilt in 1983. Today 
it houses the Golden Gate Museum, which is open to everyone eager to feel the atmosphere of Medieval Rus. <a href=#>Read more >>></a>

<h3 align="center">Kyiv Pechersk Lavra Monastery</h3>
<p>The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra Monastery is one of the oldest monasteries of Kyiv Rus. It is the most sacred place in the city, the spiritual center of 
Ukraine and a second Jerusalem for Orthodox Christians. The Lavra was built more than a thousand year age over a labyrinth of caves. Later on, 
golden-domed temples were built, while the miles-long caves were turned into a necropolis for Orthodox saints. The shades of the underground vaults 
shelter 123 saints, who have been resting in glass coffins for many centuries. Today their relics are worshiped by thousands of Orthodox Christians 
from all over the world. Scolars fail to explain how human bodies defeat time and don’t decay without being embalmed. Even the most hard-nosed 
materialists have to admin the possibility of a spiritual interpretation of this phenomenon. Another phenomenon is the unique old frescos preserved 
on the walls of the labyrinth. The Kyiv Pechersk Lavra is included on the UNESCO World Heritage list.<a href=#>Read more >>></a>

<h3 align="center">St. Sophia’s Cathedral, Kyiv, Ukraine</h3>
<p>Scholars say that St. Sophia’s Cathedral of Kyiv is a perfect example of the synthesis of art reflecting the glory and majesty of Kyiv Rus. 
Kyiv’s Sophia ensemble is included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites. Built in the 11th century on the order of Grand Prince Yaroslav the 
Wise, Kyiv’s Sophia was the spiritual , political, social and cultural development center of Kyiv Rus. This was where Kyiv’s princes were crowned, 
foreign ambassadors received and important interstate treaties were signed. It is here that Grand Prince Yaroslav founded the first library in this 
part of the world. Sophia also served as a burial place. The sarcophagus of Yaroslav the Wise is still kept at the cathedral. Grand Prince Yaroslav 
is a prominent figure in the history of Kyiv Rus. He was the one who established close dynastic relations with leading European countries of the 
time. His daughter Anne became the Queen of France (Anne de Russie) in the 1050s. Her statue is still one of the main decorations of the Alexander 
Bridge in Paris. 
<h3 align="center">Mykhailivsky Zolotoverhy Cathedral</h3>
<p>Reconstruction of the Mykhaylivsky Zolotoverkhy (St. Michael’s Golden-Domed) Cathedral has become a symbol of true spiritual recovery in Ukraine. 
The original building of the Cathedral, destroyed during Soviet era, since the 12th century inspired warriors to defend Kyiv Rus from foreign 
invaders. However, the Cathedral was demolished during the atheistic campaigns of the Communist regime during the 1930th. In 2000-2001, the careful 
hands of Ukrainian architects reconstructed the cathedral in strict compliance with and respect to the old design. Today it entices and enchants 
thousands of visitors on a daily basis with its original beauty.
